TODO:
  1) Incorporate binary translation functionality into separator.py
  2) Create a linux-friendly version of separator.py
    i) This would include flags
    
As of now, the Covert.py and separator.py are standalone, and are intended to remain so.
separator.py is intended to set up scenarios for Covert.py to crack.
Binary.py is also available as standalone, but is to be incorporated into separator.py
