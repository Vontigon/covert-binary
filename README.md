TODO:

  X 1) Incorporate binary translation functionality into separator.py
  
  X 2) Create a linux-terminal-friendly version of separate.py (more flags, less fluff)
  
    3) Have it create the files???
    
As of now, the Covert.py and separator.py are standalone, and are intended to remain so.

separator.py is intended to set up scenarios for Covert.py to crack.

Binary.py is also available as standalone, but is to be incorporated into separator.py
